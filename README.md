SQL Murder Mystery Solution
This repository contains my solution to the SQL Murder Mystery game, an interactive learning experience designed to teach SQL concepts through a detective-themed scenario.
About the SQL Murder Mystery
The SQL Murder Mystery is an open-source project created by Knight Lab at Northwestern University. The game presents a murder scenario where players must use SQL queries to search through a database of clues to identify the killer.
My Approach
I solved this mystery by working through a series of queries that allowed me to:

Examine the initial crime scene report
Identify and interview witnesses
Cross-reference witness statements with event data
Analyze suspect profiles and activities
Connect evidence to identify the murderer

The SQL queries in this repository document my investigative process from start to finish, demonstrating the use of:

Basic SELECT statements
Filtering with WHERE clauses
Joining multiple tables (INNER JOIN)
Aggregate functions
Subqueries
Data filtering and pattern matching

What I Learned
This exercise reinforced my understanding of relational databases and SQL query writing, specifically:

How to effectively navigate relationships between multiple tables
Techniques for filtering and analyzing data
The importance of carefully crafting queries to extract meaningful information
Practical application of database concepts in a problem-solving context
